## 0.0.15-pre

- Fixes standalone enum emission: named enums at the translation-unit root
  were routed through the macro-deferral path and only emitted when an
  included function signature referenced their type. They now go through the
  type extractor (matching upstream `ffigen`), so enums that appear only as
  bitmask constants (no typed signature reference) are emitted as well.

## 0.0.14-pre

- Restores the generated API and output behavior from `0.0.12-pre`.
- Preserves the typed-data `.address` fixes introduced in `0.0.13-pre`,
  including support for `Int64List`.

## 0.0.13-pre

- Fixes `.address` for typed lists backed by the Emscripten heap.
- Adds typed-data address coverage to the bundled Emscripten example.
